        "Python is an interpreted programming language whose main philosophy is that it is readable by anyone with basic programming knowledge. In addition, it has a series of characteristics that make it very particular and that, without a doubt, provide it with many advantages and are at the root of its widespread use:\n",
        "\n",
        "* It is free since it is an open source language so there is no license to pay for its use.\n",
        "* It is very flexible and easy to learn independently.\n",
        "* Can be used in web application design or artificial intelligence.\n",
        "* Phyton is suitable for any platform.\n",
